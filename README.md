# NPDBresearch

This is just a primitive analysis of the NPDB data.


## How to Run
Recommend open it in colab by clicking https://colab.research.google.com/github/jokerkeny/NPDBresearch/blob/main/NPDBresearchEDA.ipynb, where you can run all cells and make your own modifications.

If you use github to preview it, some format and plot can't show correctly.

*There are some warning and running errors, but they don't affect the results*
